# USER PROTOCOL INSTRUCTIONS - READ EVERY TIME
## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL - FIRST PRINCIPLES APPROACH

**MANDATORY REMINDER**: This tasks.md is your ultimate all-in-one instructions file that serves as:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- README documentation  
- Task management system
- User UI/UX prospect-to-customer journey guide
- First principles validation checkpoint

**PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **ASSUME YOU ARE WRONG**: Always assume every line of code is incorrect until proven right through first principles
2. **CHECK TASKS.MD BETWEEN EVERY LINE OF CODE**: Visit this file before and after every single code change
